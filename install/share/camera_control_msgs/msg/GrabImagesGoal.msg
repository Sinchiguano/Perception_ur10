# Flag which indicates if the exposure times are provided and hence should be

bool exposure_given

# Only relevant, if exposure_given is true:
# The list of target exposure times in microseconds.
# It is possible to grab only one image as well as several images with
# different exposure times. This values can be overriden from the brightness
# search, in case that the flag exposure_fixed is not true.

# Flag which indicates if the gain is provided and hence should be set before
# grabbing
bool gain_given

# Only relevant, if gain_given is true:
# The target gain in percent of the maximal value the camera supports.
# For USB-Cameras, the gain is in dB, for GigE-Cameras it is given in so
# called 'device specific units'. This value can be overriden from the
# brightness search, in case that the gain_fixed flag is set to false.
float32[] gain_values

# Flag which indicates if the gamma value is provided and hence should be set
# before grabbing
bool gamma_given

# Only relevant, if gain_given is true:
# Gamma correction of pixel intensity.
# Adjusts the brightness of the pixel values output by the camera's sensor
# to account for a non-linearity in the human perception of brightness or
# of the display system (such as CRT).
float32[] gamma_values

# Flag which indicates if the brightness values are provided and hence should
# be set before grabbing
bool brightness_given

# Only relevant, if brightness_given is true:
# The average intensity values of the images. It depends the exposure time
# as well as the gain setting.
float32[] brightness_values

# Only relevant, if brightness_given is true:
# If the camera should try reach the desired brightness, at least one of the
# following flags MUST be set. If both are set, the interface will use the
# profile that tries to keep the gain at minimum to reduce white noise.
# 'exposure_auto' will adapt the exposure time to reach the brightness, wheras
# 'gain_auto' does so by adapting the gain. If one of these flags is set to
# false, the connected property will be kept fix.
# In most of the cases trying to reach a target brightness only by varying the
# gain and keeping the exposure time fix is not a good approach, because the
# exposure range is many times higher than the gain range.
