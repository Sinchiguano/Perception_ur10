# This message defines meta information for a camera. It should be in a

#
#   image_raw - raw data from the camera driver, possibly Bayer encoded

#   image_color      - color, distorted
#   image_rect       - monochrome, rectified
#   image_rect_color - color, rectified
#
# The image_pipeline contains packages (image_proc, stereo_image_proc)
# for producing the four processed image topics from image_raw and
# camera_info. The meaning of the camera parameters are described in
# detail at http://www.ros.org/wiki/image_pipeline/CameraInfo.
#
# The image_geometry package provides a user-friendly interface to
# common operations using this meta information. If you want to, e.g.,
# project a 3d point into image coordinates, we strongly recommend
# using image_geometry.
#
# If the camera is uncalibrated, the matrices D, K, R, P should be left
# zeroed out. In particular, clients may assume that K[0] == 0.0
# indicates an uncalibrated camera.
